.ie n .IP "$trace = $e\->trace" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$trace\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->trace" 4
.IX Item "$trace = $e->trace"
Get a snapshot of the Test2::Util::Trace as it was when this event was
generated
.ie n .IP "$bool = $e\->causes_fail" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$bool\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->causes_fail" 4
.IX Item "$bool = $e->causes_fail"
Returns true if this event should result in a test failure. In general this
should be false.
.ie n .IP "$bool = $e\->increments_count" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$bool\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->increments_count" 4
.IX Item "$bool = $e->increments_count"
Should be true if this event should result in a test count increment.
.ie n .IP "$e\->callback($hub)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$e\fR\->callback($hub)" 4
.IX Item "$e->callback($hub)"
If your event needs to have extra effects on the Test2::Hub you can override
this method.
.Sp
This is called \fB\s-1BEFORE\s0\fR your event is passed to the formatter.
.ie n .IP "$call = $e\->created" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$call\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->created" 4
.IX Item "$call = $e->created"
Get the \f(CW\*(C`caller()\*(C'\fR details from when the event was generated. This is usually
inside a tools package. This is typically used for debugging.
.ie n .IP "$num = $e\->nested" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$num\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->nested" 4
.IX Item "$num = $e->nested"
If this event is nested inside of other events, this should be the depth of
nesting. (This is mainly for subtests)
.ie n .IP "$bool = $e\->global" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$bool\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->global" 4
.IX Item "$bool = $e->global"
Set this to true if your event is global, that is \s-1ALL\s0 threads and processes
should see it no matter when or where it is generated. This is not a common
thing to want, it is used by bail-out and skip_all to end testing.
.ie n .IP "$code = $e\->terminate" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$code\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->terminate" 4
.IX Item "$code = $e->terminate"
This is called \fB\s-1AFTER\s0\fR your event has been passed to the formatter. This
should normally return undef, only change this if your event should cause the
test to exit immediately.
.Sp
If you want this event to cause the test to exit you should return the exit
code here. Exit code of 0 means exit success, any other integer means exit with
failure.
.Sp
This is used by Test2::Event::Plan to exit 0 when the plan is
\&'skip_all'. This is also used by Test2::Event:Bail to force the test
to exit with a failure.
.Sp
This is called after the event has been sent to the formatter in order to
ensure the event is seen and understood.
.ie n .IP "$todo = $e\->todo" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$todo\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->todo" 4
.IX Item "$todo = $e->todo"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$e\->set_todo($todo)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$e\fR\->set_todo($todo)" 4
.IX Item "$e->set_todo($todo)"
.PD
Get/Set the todo reason on the event. Any value other than \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR makes the
event '\s-1TODO\s0'.
.Sp
Not all events make use of this field, but they can all have it set/cleared.
.ie n .IP "$bool = $e\->diag_todo" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$bool\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->diag_todo" 4
.IX Item "$bool = $e->diag_todo"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$e\->diag_todo($todo)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$e\fR\->diag_todo($todo)" 4
.IX Item "$e->diag_todo($todo)"
.PD
True if this event should be considered '\s-1TODO\s0' for diagnostics purposes. This
essentially means that any message that would go to \s-1STDERR\s0 will go to \s-1STDOUT\s0
instead so that a harness will hide it outside of verbose mode.
.ie n .IP "$msg = $e\->summary" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$msg\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->summary" 4
.IX Item "$msg = $e->summary"
This is intended to be a human readable summary of the event. This should
ideally only be 1\-line long, but you can use multiple lines if necessary. This
is intended for human consumption, you do not need to make it easy for machines
to understand.
.Sp
The default is to simply return the event package name.
.ie n .IP "($count, $directive, $reason) = $e\->\fIsets_plan()\fR" 4
.el .IP "($count, \f(CW$directive\fR, \f(CW$reason\fR) = \f(CW$e\fR\->\fIsets_plan()\fR" 4
.IX Item "($count, $directive, $reason) = $e->sets_plan()"
Check if this event sets the testing plan. It will return an empty list if it
does not. If it does set the plan it will return a list of 1 to 3 items in
order: Expected Test Count, Test Directive, Reason for directive.
.ie n .IP "$bool = $e\->diagnostics" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$bool\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->diagnostics" 4
.IX Item "$bool = $e->diagnostics"
True if the event contains diagnostics info. This is useful because a
non-verbose harness may choose to hide events that are not in this category.
Some formatters may choose to send these to \s-1STDERR\s0 instead of \s-1STDOUT\s0 to ensure
they are seen.
.ie n .IP "$bool = $e\->no_display" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$bool\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->no_display" 4
.IX Item "$bool = $e->no_display"
False by default. This will return true on events that should not be displayed
by formatters.
.ie n .IP "$id = $e\->in_subtest" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$id\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->in_subtest" 4
.IX Item "$id = $e->in_subtest"
If the event is inside a subtest this should have the subtest \s-1ID\s0.
.ie n .IP "$id = $e\->subtest_id" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$id\fR = \f(CW$e\fR\->subtest_id" 4
.IX Item "$id = $e->subtest_id"
If the event is a final subtest event, this should contain the subtest \s-1ID\s0.

This object consumes Test2::Util::ExternalMeta which provides a consistent
way for you to attach meta-data to instances of this class. This is useful for
